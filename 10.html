		<h1>The Guest House</h1>
		<p><span style="font-size:16pt">This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival.</span></p>
    <ul>
      <div style="font-size:16pt">
      <div style="color:green;font-weight:bold"><li>A joy,</li>
      <li>a depression,</li>
      <li> a meanness,</li>
      </div>
      <em>some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.</em>
      </div>

		<span style="font-size:16pt;font-weight:bold;color:purple">Welcome and entertain them all!</span>

    <ol>
    <br>
    <li>Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,<br>who violently sweep your house<br>empty of its furniture,<br>still, treat each guest honorably.</li>
    <br>
    <li>He may be clearing you out<br>for some new delight.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The dark thought, the shame, the malice.<br>meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size:16pt;color:blue">Be grateful for whatever comes. because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.
