		<p>Welcome and entertain them  &nbsp a &nbsp l &nbsp l!<br>Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,<br>who violently sweep your house<br>empty of its furniture,<br>still, treat each guest  &nbsp h &nbsp o &nbsp n &nbsp o &nbsp r &nbsp a &nbsp b &nbsp l &nbsp y.<br>He may be clearing you out<br>for some new  &nbsp d &nbsp e &nbsp l &nbsp i &nbsp g &nbsp h &nbsp t.</p>
