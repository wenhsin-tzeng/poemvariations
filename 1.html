		<h3>The Guest House</h3>
		<p>This being human is a guest house.<br>Every morning a new arrival.</p>
		<p>A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br>some momentary awareness comes<br>as an unexpected visitor.</p>
		<p>Welcome and entertain them all!<br>Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,<br>who violently sweep your house<br>empty of its furniture,<br>still, treat each guest honorably.<br>He may be clearing you out<br>for some new delight.</p>
		<p>The dark thought, the shame, the malice.<br>meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.</p>
		<p>Be grateful for whatever comes.<br>because each has been sent<br>as a guide from beyond.</p>
